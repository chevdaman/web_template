    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Ned Nedialkov was born and raised in Bulgaria. He received M.Sc. (1995) and Ph.D. (1999) degrees in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>, and has been with the Department of Computing and Software at <a href="https://www.mcmaster.ca/">McMaster University</a> since 1999. He was a long-term visitor during the Thematic Year on Numerical and Computational Challenges in Science and Engineering at the Fields Institute 2001-02, spent a sabbatical year at the Center for Applied Scientific Computing at the <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> in 2005-06, and was a guest of the Arénaire project at <a href="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/web/nav/">École Normale Supérieure de Lyon</a> in the summer of 2008.
    </p>
    <p>His research is in the general area of scientific computing and mathematical software with emphasis on interval numerical methods for differential equations and numerical methods for differential-algebraic equations. He is the author of the VNODE and VNODE-LP packages for computing rigorous bounds on solutions in initial-value problems for ordinary differential equations, and the DAETS package for solving high-index differential algebraic equations.

    <h2>Ph.D. and M.Sc. positions</h2>
    <p>I am seeking candidates for two industrially-funded Ph.D. positions. The research will be on mixed-precision numerical algorithms and high-performance computing to accelerate the performance of various solvers. Strong computational background and C++ skills are required.
      Also, I am seeking M.Sc. candidates with strong C++ skills and background in computer science, applied math, physics, or mechanical engineering.
